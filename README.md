### parcel-react-bp
a react application boilerplate that comes with the following:
  1. Typescript
  2. Linter (with .eslint.json configured with airbnb rules)
  3. Prettier (with .prettierrc.json and some rules I like)
  4. Parcel.js to do dev and build the project
  
### TODO
 - [ ] add react
 - [ ] add typescript
 - [ ] add parcel
 - [ ] prettier and eslint
