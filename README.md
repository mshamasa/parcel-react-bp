### parcel-react-boilerplate
a simple React application with parcel js as the bundler, with the following:
  1. Typescript
  2. Linter (with .eslint.json configured with airbnb rules)
  3. Prettier (with .prettierrc.json and some rules I like)
  4. Parcel.js to do dev and build the project
  
### how it works
  1. clone this project
  2. `yarn/npx install`
  3. `yarn/npx dev`
